Honestly, I have no idea why it took me so long to buy a slow cooker. I was hesitant to make the investment (ok, like $30), but it is completely worth it. It makes cooking meat really easy, and literally anything you throw in there comes out delicious. After making some amazing pulled pork, I was antsy to use my new favorite appliance again, so I decided to make a roast chicken, which was even easier than the pork. 

I bought a 4.5lb chicken, and was kind of scared because I don’t have a meat thermometer to check for doneness, but it wasn’t even necessary. I cooked the chicken for 5 hours on high, and then threw it in the oven for a bit to make the skin brown and crispy (don’t skip this step!). The chicken fed three hungry people and we still got some leftovers. The abundant leftovers are pretty much the best part of this meal.

I wasn’t sure what to make as a side dish, but I opted for some artichoke risotto since I figured the homemade chicken stock would take this dish to the next level, and I was right. The chicken stock came out really lemony, which complemented the artichokes perfectly. I was also too lazy to use fresh artichokes, despite them being in season and all, but no one noticed and I don’t think it made much of a difference.

### For the chicken:
* 1 4-5lb chicken, insides removed
* 2 lemons
* 1 head of garlic
* fresh thyme
* fresh rosemary

I followed Giada de Laurentis’ instructions and DIDN’T wash the chicken after removing it from the package. Honestly, after watching this video I got really freaked out by chicken germ contamination. So, basically, never wash chicken. Instead, pat the chicken dry with paper towels and remove insides. Rub with salt and pepper, inside and out. Stuff chicken with some garlic cloves and half a chopped lemon. 

Place chicken in slow cooker and cover with garlic, lemon slices and herbs. I added a few pats of butter to the top of the chicken as well. That’s actually the whole recipe. Set slow cooker on high and go about your day, come back in five hours and bask in the delicious aroma that is now permeating your kitchen. 

###For the Risotto:
* 2 cups Arborio rice (about one package)
* ¾ cup dry white wine
* 1 lemon
* about 1 cup grated parmegiano regiano (feel free to use more or less)
* one small onion
* 2 cloves garlic 
* About 4 cups of stock from slow cooker
* parsley
* salt and pepper to taste
* Canned artichoke hearts

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. After your chicken is done (again, I left mine in for five hours on high) carefully remove it from slow cooker. I used two serving spoons to pick it up, and luckily it didn’t totally fall apart but if it does, no worries, just serve it carved up. Place chicken in a baking dish and put that in the oven for about 30 mins. In the meantime, you can make the risotto. Ladle about 4 cups super fresh chicken broth from slow cooker into a small pot and add some water. Leave this simmering on super low, covered. 

In a separate pot, sauté finely chopped onion with some olive oil until translucent. Add garlic and cook until fragrant. Add Arborio rice, mixing until all rice is covered in oil, and add wine. Once wine is absorbed, add half a cup of warmed stock. Keep doing this, half a cup at a time, for about 20 minutes or until rice is fully cooked. Honestly, just follow your intuition and taste often, I promise it isn’t as complicated as it sounds. As you’re working on this, remove chicken from oven and let rest for 10 minutes, or as long as it takes you to finish the risotto.

Once rice is cooked and last bits of stock are fully absorbed, add the parmesan cheese and the risotto will get super creamy. Remove from heat and add about ¾ can artichoke hearts, juiced lemon and fresh parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste. 

Carve chicken and serve with sides of risotto. Impress friends and enjoy this delicious and simple meal. 

If you have leftover risotto, make sure to make arancini the next day!
